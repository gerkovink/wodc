## In no particular order

- **Dark and incomplete Data**
  
  - Data problems where not all information to find the answer has been (made) available
  
- **Computational Evaluation**
  
  - To what extend can the solutions offered by algorithms be used and trusted? And how can we make this work for us?
  
- **Machine learning**
  
  - A preference for adversarial modeling
  - Bridging the gap between statistics and computer science
  
- **Software Development**
 
  - Giving users the necesseary tools to work with data in a timely manner
  
- **Generative AI in Higher Education**
 
  - The past, current and future scope of AI use/skills by students and faculty alike


## Running and recently finished projects

- **Dark and incomplete Data**
  
  - `mice` in `R` (code developer)
  - `jaspImputation` in `JASP` (ongoing)
  - research and development of imputation methodology. e.g. `mice.impute.xbgoost()` and `mice.impute.bart()` and `mice.impute.stan4bart()` (ongoing)
  
- **Computational Evaluation**
  - `shinyMice` in `R` (with Hanne Oberman)
